# Do not include your name in your social media username.
Explanation: Including your real first name, middle name, last name, and/or initials, etc is incredibly common in today's social media landscape. However, this is an issue relating to the privacy and safety of the user. Including a detail such as your name makes you easily indentifiable by friends and famlily members, but also to bad actors who may want to harm you.

Solution: Create a fake name (or pseudonym) that is still easily recognizable, but only by those who you want to recognize you.
